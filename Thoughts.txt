We could use output code from GUI genie to directly create xml or txt
We could then use them directly to crete interface in another language

While applying multiple layout use genie to create only one container
{
	composite layouts can work by combining the code from constituents:
	If you focus on a single layout, you can focus on all the code you need to layout the constituents into it without worrying about how those constituents were laid out themselves.

	This means you can separate/detach/modularize

	If children containers are instantiated (and laid out) before parent containers, then there will be no problem of undefined components being used to layout a content into any container
}

Leave all layout xml files within projects, but composite layouts should be arraged using a tree (folders structure)
